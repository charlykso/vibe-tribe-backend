Design Philosophy
Mobile-First Responsive Design ensuring compatibility across all devices
Professional UI/UX with consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
Accessibility-First using Radix UI primitives and proper ARIA labels
Performance Optimized with code splitting and efficient re-renders
Modern Aesthetics featuring gradients, glass morphism, and smooth animations
Key Technical Decisions
Component-Driven Architecture - Each feature is a separate, focused component
TypeScript Throughout - Full type safety across the entire application
Utility-First CSS - Tailwind for rapid, consistent styling
State Colocation - Component state kept close to where it's used
Responsive Design - Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts
Database Migration - Successfully migrated from Supabase to Firebase Firestore
API-First Design - RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
Security-First - JWT authentication, input validation, and organization-scoped access
