Project Overview
We've built a comprehensive Social Media & Community Management Platform called "VibeTribe" - a modern, professional web application designed for managing multiple social media accounts and communities.

Tech Stack Used
Frontend Framework & Build Tools
React 18 with TypeScript for the main application framework
Vite as the build tool and development server
React Router DOM for client-side routing and navigation
UI & Styling
Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design
shadcn/ui component library for professional, accessible UI components
Lucide React for consistent, scalable icons throughout the app
CSS Variables for theming support (light/dark mode)
State Management & Data
React Hooks (useState) for local component state
@tanstack/react-query for server state management and data fetching
React Hook Form with Zod validation for form handling
Charts & Visualization
Recharts library for analytics charts and data visualization
Notifications & UX
Sonner for toast notifications
Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components

Design Philosophy
Mobile-First Responsive Design ensuring compatibility across all devices
Professional UI/UX with consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
Accessibility-First using Radix UI primitives and proper ARIA labels
Performance Optimized with code splitting and efficient re-renders
Modern Aesthetics featuring gradients, glass morphism, and smooth animations
Key Technical Decisions
Component-Driven Architecture - Each feature is a separate, focused component
TypeScript Throughout - Full type safety across the entire application
Utility-First CSS - Tailwind for rapid, consistent styling
State Colocation - Component state kept close to where it's used
Responsive Design - Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts
Current Status
The application is a fully functional prototype with:

✅ Complete landing page with marketing content
✅ Functional dashboard with multiple sections
✅ Professional UI/UX with dark/light themes
