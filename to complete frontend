Next Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Core Functionality
typescript

Copy
// 1. Create a PostComposer component
interface Post {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  platforms: Platform[];
  scheduledFor: Date;
  media?: Media[];
  status: 'draft' | 'scheduled' | 'published';
}

// 2. Add a Calendar component for scheduling
// 3. Build the Unified Inbox with mock messages
// 4. Create Platform Integration cards
Phase 2: Community Features
Member management table with actions
Moderation queue with AI sentiment
Community analytics dashboard
Engagement automation setup
Phase 3: Team Collaboration
Role-based access control UI
Approval workflows
Team activity feed
Task assignment system
Backend Integration Recommendations
Since you mentioned Supabase, here's a suggested schema structure:

sql

Copy
-- Core tables
users, organizations, team_members

-- Social media tables
social_accounts, posts, scheduled_posts, analytics_data

-- Community tables
communities, community_members, messages, moderation_queue

-- Engagement tables
conversations, responses, automation_rules
UI/UX Enhancements to Consider
Onboarding Flow: Guide new users through platform connection
Empty States: Helpful messages when no data exists
Keyboard Shortcuts: Power user features
Real-time Updates: WebSocket integration for live data
Mobile App: Consider React Native for mobile
Monetization UI Elements
Pricing page with tier comparison
Upgrade prompts at limit points
Usage meters in dashboard
Billing section in settings
Would you like me to create specific components for any of these features? For example, I could build you a:

Post composer with multi-platform preview
Visual calendar component for scheduling
Unified inbox with filtering
Community member management table








Which feature would add the most value to your MVP right now?
